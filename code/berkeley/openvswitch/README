The server architecture with OpenVSwitch and POX are as follows:



		   [mbox]  [mbox]	
		    |  |    |  |	
		 +--------------+	
[tun0]=[tap0] == |     OVS	| == [tap1] == Click == [tun1] == MASQUERADE == [eth0]
	 	 +------ -------+
		        |
		     +-----+
		     | POX |
		     +-----+


Fixed Interfaces:
[tun0] => OpenVPN (soon to be StrongSwan) endpoint
[tap0] => OVS only sees Tap (not Tun) interfaces -- conversion from tun0.
[tap1] => Output Interface for OpenVSwitch, converts to tun1 and then NAT.
[tun1] => NOT connected to OpenVSwitch, directly wired to NAT at eth0
