The server architecture with OpenVSwitch and POX are as follows:



		   [mbox]  [mbox]	
		    |  |    |  |	
		 +--------------+	
[vpn]=[vpn_tap] == |     OVS	| == [tap_egress] == Click == [tun_egress] == MASQUERADE == [eth0]
	 	 +------ -------+
		        |
		     +-----+
		     | POX |
		     +-----+


Fixed Interfaces:
[vpn] == (Not really: 00:01:01:01:01:03) => OpenVPN (soon to be StrongSwan) endpoint
[vpn_tap] == 00:01:01:01:01:04, 1.0.0.4 => OVS only sees Tap (not Tun) interfaces -- conversion from vpn.
[tap_egress] == 00:01:01:01:01:01, 1.0.0.2 => Output Interface for OpenVSwitch, converts to tun_egress and then NAT.
[tun_egress] == 00:01:01:01:01:02, 1.0.0.3 => NOT connected to OpenVSwitch, directly wired to NAT at eth0
