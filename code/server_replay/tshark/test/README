1. skype.pcap 
   -- RAW pcap file dumped by wireshark
2. dump_[*]_out.pcap
   -- pcap file that is captured on the server side while replaying, generated by "udp_server_gevent.py"
3. skype.pcap_client_json, skype.pcap_client_pickle, skype.pcap_server_json, skype.pcap_server_pickle
   -- json/pickle files for replaying, genereated by "udp_parser.py"
4. [*]_[_client_sent.txt|_client_rcvd.txt|_server_sent.txt|_server_rcvd.txt]_interPacketIntervals.txt
   -- raw data files to caculate the jitter value

6. In Android, platform API will be used rather than directly capuring a "client.pcap" file due to the lack of root priviledge (TODO)
