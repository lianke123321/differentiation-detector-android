\begin{abstract}
Characterizing Internet traffic naturally generated by mobile devices remains an open problem because mobile devices and their OSes provide no built-in service for monitoring and reporting all network traffic. 
This opacity offers researchers with a limited perspective on mobile Internet traffic obtained by either relying on traces from carrier networks, monitoring traffic flowing through \wifi access points, or logging data traffic on custom OSes. 

In this paper, we take an alternative approach: measurement through indirection
Specifically, we exploit the fact that most mobile OSes support proxying via virtual private networks (VPNs).
Sending mobile Internet traffic through a proxy server under our control enables us to monitor all flows regardless of device, OS, or access technology.
We argue that our solution, platname, incurs reasonable overheads and can be configured on existing phones without any OS modifications, making it feasible for large-scale deployment.

We report the results of a 6-month IRB-approved measurement study in which we used \platname to detail the characteristics of OS services and applications. 
We also report on controlled experiments performed using \platname not only to detail the behavior of popular and suspicious mobile applications but also to peek into SSL traffic.
