\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper described how we use proxying to provide a comprehensive view of Internet traffic 
generated by mobile devices. The key observation is that most devices already support traffic 
indirection via VPNs; by using VPN servers as proxying and instrumenting them to record 
traffic flows, we can passively monitor traffic from mobile devices regardless of access 
technology, device or OS. Using this unique view of mobile-device traffic, we conduct 
controlled experiments and user studies to characterize and classify apps and to identify 
leaking of privacy-sensitive data. As part of future work, we are investigating additional 
techniques to improve traffic classification and to identify PII. To understand network 
behavior from a much more diverse set of users and devices, we are deploying 
a second study that is IRB-approved for a larger set of users without requiring 
in-person interviews.
