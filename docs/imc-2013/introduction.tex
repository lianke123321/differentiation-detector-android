\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Mobile systems consist of walled gardens inside gated communities,
i.e., locked-down operating systems running on devices that interact
over a closed and opaque mobile network. 

Our contributions are as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item We present VPNs as a platform to provide a comprehensive
  perspective of mobile network traffic. Our VPN based platform has a
  low barrier to entry and can be used to perform measurement studies
  regardless of the mobile operating system, device type, wireless
  technologies, and service provider.    
\item We use this platform to compare the behavior of popular mobile
  applications over Android and iOS. We also compare the behavior of
  these application over Wifi and 3G. 
\item We provide a definition for a ``Well Behaved App''. We then
  check if the \tbd{Number} popular apps on Android and \tbd{Number}
  apps on iOS are \emph{well behaved}.
\end{itemize}
