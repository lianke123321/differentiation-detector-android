%Mobile systems consist of walled gardens inside gated communities, i.e., locked-down operating systems running on devices that interact over a closed and opaque mobile network. 

Our contributions are as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item We posit that VPNs can be used build a practical platform to monitor mobile Internet traffic regardless of the mobile operating system, device type, access technologies, and service provider.
\item We present \platname, a practical platform for comprehensive monitoring of mobile Internet traffic. 
\platname builds on existing functionality provided by Mobile OSes to manage VPN tunnels. 
\item We use \platname to compare the behavior of popular mobile applications over Android and iOS. We observe \tbd{values come here}. We also compare the behavior of these application over Wifi and 3G. 
\item \tbd{Results based on Amy work}.
\item \tbd{Results from an on going IRB based study of 30 users. We use these results to compare our observations from exisiting studies. The key take home is that these measurements were did not require custom OSes, ISP support, or support from marketplaces, warranty voiding of devices.}
\end{itemize}
