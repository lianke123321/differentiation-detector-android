\section{Characterize Applications}
\label{sec:characterize-app}

\begin{packedenumerate}
\item How does an application behavior change with operating system and access technology?
\item How intrusive are popular applications?
\end{packedenumerate}

\subsection{Characterize Facebook Applications}

Why Facebook was chosen?

What do we observe ?

What do we see in the User Agent Fields.

How do we characterize ads and Analytics.

What fraction of traffic is due to ads and analytics.

Breakup over Cell and Wifi and Android and iOS.

What more do we observer.

Now motivate for the next section saying we observe PII leaks. 

\subsection{Identify Instrusive Applications}

Why did we do this test?

How did we perform our experiments?

What did we observe?

What is different from previous observations?

What insights do we gain from our results?
