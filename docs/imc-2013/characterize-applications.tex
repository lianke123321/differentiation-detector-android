\section{Application Characterization}
\label{sec:characterize-app}

To analyze applications, we need to first identify the applications that is responsible for the flows. 
Once identified we need to analyze the applications. 
For analysis we concentrate on including {\it how much} data is sent or accessed, {\it what} data is sent,  or {\it with whom} the app communications.
``How much'' is important to conserve both bandwidth caps and battery capacity.
``With whom'' is important to protect users from excessive tracking.
Finally, ``what data'' is important because apps may unnecessarily leak personally identifiable information (PII) such as user email address, IMEI, contact information, or other stored data either to the app provider or worse, to any eavesdropper on a public WiFi connection.
