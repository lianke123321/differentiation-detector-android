\begin{abstract}

Today's mobile systems make it difficult to obtain visibility into
network traffic and provide few mechanisms for changing how devices
and apps use the Internet. As a result, we have a poor understanding
of - and limited ability to improve - network performance, battery
consumption, data-quota usage and privacy in the mobile
environment. In this paper, we address these issues using Meddle, a
platform for improving transparency for mobile networking traffic and
enabling fine-grained control over flows generated by mobile devices.

Meddle achieves this by using virtual private networks (supported by
nearly all devices) to forward traffic from devices to a server that
uses software-middlebox techniques to modify, shape and/or block
network traffic before forwarding it to the destination. Unlike
previous work, Meddle provides the ability to characterize and control
mobile-device traffic on user devices regardless of the OS, carrier or
access technology â€“ without rooting the device or modifying the
default OS.  Further, Meddle allows us to experiment with new
techniques for interposing on mobile traffic in a way that improves
performance, resource consumption and privacy.

This paper describes results from our initial deployment of Meddle,
showing that it imposes reasonable overhead while providing users with
services previously unavailable on mobile devices. We further use the
network flows traversing Meddle to reveal unexpected and alarming
network behavior of mobile apps made visible through our
approach. Last, we discuss how Meddle can address these and other
issues in the mobile environment without requiring app or OS
modification.
