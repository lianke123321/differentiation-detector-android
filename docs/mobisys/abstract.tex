\begin{abstract}

Today's mobile systems make it difficult to obtain visibility into
network traffic and provide few mechanisms for changing how devices
and apps use the Internet. As a result, we have a poor understanding
of -- and limited ability to improve -- network performance, battery
consumption, data-quota usage, and privacy in the mobile
environment. In this paper, we address these issues using \meddle, a
platform that improves transparency for mobile networking traffic and
enables fine-grained control over flows generated by mobile devices.

\meddle achieves this by using virtual private networks (supported by
nearly all devices) to forward traffic from devices to a server that
uses software middleboxes to modify, shape and/or block
network traffic before forwarding it to the destination. Unlike
previous work, \meddle provides the ability to characterize and control
mobile-device traffic on user devices regardless of the OS, carrier or
access technology -- without rooting the device or modifying the
default OS.  Further, \meddle allows us to experiment with new
techniques for interposing on mobile traffic in a way that improves
performance, resource consumption and privacy.

This paper describes the architecture of \meddle and results from
its initial deployment, showing that it imposes a modest
overhead while providing users with services previously unavailable on
mobile devices. We further use the network flows traversing \meddle to
reveal unexpected and alarming network behavior of mobile apps made
visible through our approach. Last, we discuss how \meddle can address
these and other issues in the mobile environment without requiring app
or OS modification.
