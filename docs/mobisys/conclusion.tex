\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work we described \meddle, a system that improves transparency and 
control for mobile network traffic. We achieve portable, pervasive and passive 
coverage by using VPN connections to redirect device traffic  
to a server we control. We then use software middleboxes to interpose on 
traffic and thus provide users and researchers with control of flows from mobile devices. 
Our solution exhibits reasonably low overheads, provides comprehensive 
visibility into mobile network traffic, and allows us to easily deploy new 
services without requiring additional support from devices, OSes, apps or 
service providers. We are currently expanding our user base, building a 
software infrastructure that efficiently supports a distributed deployment on cloud 
infrastructure and deploying new services that run atop \meddle.
