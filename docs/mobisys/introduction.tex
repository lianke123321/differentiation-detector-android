Mobile systems consist of walled gardens inside gated 
communities, i.e., locked-down operating systems running 
devices that interact over a closed and opaque mobile network. 
Despite a large collection of privacy, policy and performance issues
in mobile networks~\cite{enck:taintdroid,hornyack:appfence,speedtest,eprof},
users and researchers are faced with few options to  
characterize and address them.
%% AR: I also want to add something about longitudinal studies. This
%% platform enables such studies. 

%% From the user perspective, the problem is that subscribers to mobile
%% networks have little control compared to what they have in their wired
%% access networks. For example, in the home network, users are
%% accustomed to the ability to install custom applications that change
%% application network usage (e.g., ad blocking) and to run home routers
%% that implement policies such as network access prioritization and
%% parental controls. In the mobile environment, however, users are
%% forced to interact with a single operating system tied to their
%% device, generally use closed-source apps provided for the OS that
%% routinely violate user privacy~\cite{hornyack:appfence}, and subscribe
%% to network providers that can (and do) transparently modify, block or
%% otherwise interfere with network traffic~\cite{wang:middleboxes}.
%% Users thus need a mechanism to take back control of how their devices
%% use the mobile networks they pay for.

The lockdown of mobile devices places researchers in a similar bind.
To characterize mobile traffic and design new protocols and
services that are better tailored to the mobile environment, we would like a
framework that allows us to intercept and potentially modify traffic
generated by mobile devices as they move with users, regardless of the
device, OS or carrier. However, implementing this functionality is
difficult on mobile devices because it requires warranty-voiding
techniques such as jail breaking to access and manipulate traffic at
the network layer~\cite{enck:taintdroid}. Even when using such an
approach, carriers may manipulate traffic once it leaves the mobile
device~\cite{wang:middleboxes}, thus rendering some research
impractical. Last, some protocols and services should be implemented
in the network instead of the device (e.g., prefetching and security
filters) but researchers generally have no ability to deploy such
solutions.

%For example, studies such as those from TaintDroid researchers 
%and The New York Times highlighted the kinds of personally 
%identifiable information being leaked to app servers and third 
%parties from popular apps. The XXX study showed that mobile 
%carriers interfere with traffic by blocking ports and/or surreptitiously 
%responding to traffic on behalf of third party servers. Finally, 
%3GTest and SpeedTest studies provide insight into mobile 
%network performance but only at the time when a user initiates 
%a measurements. 

In this paper, we argue that we can provide the necessary framework to
simultaneously address these issues for users and researchers by using
middleboxes accessible through VPN tunnels, an approach we call
\meddle.  \meddle works for nearly all mobile devices out of the box:
Android, iOS, and Blackberry all support VPNs, thus providing a
portable mechanism to tunnel traffic to servers outside of the
carriers' control regardless of the mobile device's network.  Once
packets arrive at VPN servers, we can use a variety of middlebox
approaches to transform traffic to and from mobile devices. This
enables new research in both measuring and characterizing mobile
traffic, and designing new in-network features to improve the mobile
experience.

In addition to avoiding transparent interference from any  
middleboxes inside mobile carrier networks, \meddle 
enables researchers to investigate what-if scenarios for the 
impact of new middleboxes as if they were deployed in carrier 
networks. In \S~\ref{sec:apps}, we discuss several research 
directions enabled by this service including new app-accelerators, 
mobile-specific security filters and protocol manipulation 
to improve power consumption and data volume usage. Importantly, 
service providers and users can take advantage of these features 
without requiring any support from carriers or new OS-specific 
apps installed by users.

To obtain a large number of participating users for characterization
and experimental evaluation, we need to explicitly align the goals of
researchers and users. We argue that \meddle offers sufficient
incentives for users to adopt the service by offering device-wide
ad-blocking, privacy/security filters and parental controls at the
network layer -- functionality that mobile network providers do not
currently make available.


While the technologies that enable \meddle are well understood, there
are a variety of challenges and open questions we must address to
ensure a solution that is practical both for end users and
researchers. Importantly, we must design a VPN-server deployment that
does more good than harm with respect to performance and power
consumption so that we avoid a disincentive for usage
(\S\ref{sec:eval}). In addition, we would like to investigate the
extent to which we can enact optimizations that reduce page load
times, improve security, reduce data consumption and potentially even
conserve power -- all from a middlebox that resides neither on the
device nor in the carrier's network. Finally, we must address the
additional security, trust and privacy concerns that arise when
tunneling traffic outside of carrier networks into a third-party
distributed service. We discuss these issues and others in
Section~\ref{sec:discuss}.
