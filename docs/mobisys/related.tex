\section{Related Work}
\meddle builds upon two existing technologies: VPNs and middleboxes. 
In our current implementation, we rely on an IPsec~\cite{rfc:ipsec} implementation 
to tunnel traffics to \meddle servers. Sherry et al.~\cite{sherry:middleboxes} explore the opportunities 
enabled by moving middleboxes to the cloud, which includes simplifying management 
for enterprise network administrators. In contrast, our work focuses on the mobile capabilities 
software middleboxes enable rather than a redirection architecture for enterprise networks. 

\meddle provides researchers with a cross-platform, cross-carrier technique 
for capturing network usage patterns from mobile devices. Previous work 
used on-demand active measurements to characterize network measurements~\cite{wang:middleboxes,speedtest}; 
however, these measurements are restricted to the point at which users run 
the tests. Gerber et al.~\cite{gerber:passivespeed} use passive measurements alone 
to estimate transfer rates in a single carrier's network; \meddle 
will enable such analysis across multiple carriers.

We expect to use \meddle to investigate security and privacy issues in the 
traffic that mobile devices generate. By monitoring and controlling 
information at lower layers in the software stack, previous work~\cite{enck:taintdroid,hornyack:appfence,wsj:apps-watching-you} has shown 
that existing apps leak significant private information. In \meddle, we take 
this downward mobility to an extreme, moving off the end-host entirely and 
eliminating the restrictions of a lab setting.

The CloneCloud~\cite{chun:clonecloud} and MAUI~\cite{cuervo:maui} projects explored the space of moving functionality 
from mobile devices into the cloud. By interposing on user traffic, \meddle will allow us to explore some of this 
functionality without requiring device modifications.
