\section{Application: Third Party Threats}

\subsection{Mobile infection vectors}

\textbf{Two-second approach}: Get list of drive-by downloads for mobile. Potential sources:
- Websites that post this stuff
- Tweets by fake accounts from Alan's twitter data\
- Other?

Make a script that causes a device to load those malicious URLs. Identify malicious behavior from there.

\textbf{Table}: Types of malicious URLs and what they do. Rows are URL types, columns are types of behavior, cells are counts/percentages/checkmarks. 

\subsection{Mobile malware network analysis}

Get list of confirmed malware, run through Meddle, collect traces. Do the same for known non-malicous apps. 
Understand what are distinguishing network characteristics for the former vs the latter. 

Show how blacklists are ineffective. Show how effective the behavior-based analysis is.

\subsection{Unsolicited traffic}
Presumably there is none, but probably worth looking at inbound unsolicited traffic from a 
\meddle instance with no users compared to one with active users. Might find something interesting there.
