\subsection*{Abstract}
Researchers and mobile users have little visibility into the network 
traffic generated by their mobile devices and have poor control over 
how, when, and where that traffic is handled while in flight. 
This paper presents Meddle, a platform that 
addresses these limitations by interposing on mobile 
device traffic regardless of where and how the device connects to the Internet.
Meddle leverages 
VPNs and software middleboxes to improve transparency and control 
for Internet traffic from mobile systems, while providing clear incentives, strong privacy guarantees, 
and ease of deployment to end users. We discuss 
the design and implementation of our system, and evaluate its effectiveness using 
measurements from users participating in our IRB-approved study; we also present case studies of systems built atop Meddle including
identifying and blocking privacy leaks, detecting ISP interference with Internet traffic, and malware detection/blocking.
