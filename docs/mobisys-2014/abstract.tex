\subsection*{Abstract}
{\it Researchers and mobile users have little visibility into the network 
traffic generated by  mobile devices and have poor control over 
how, when, and where that traffic is sent and handled. 
This paper presents Meddle, a platform that  leverages 
VPNs and software middleboxes to improve transparency and control 
for Internet traffic from mobile systems. Meddle provides a practical way to 
interpose on all of a device's Internet traffic, while providing clear incentives, privacy guarantees, 
and ease of deployment to end users. We discuss 
the design and implementation of our system, and evaluate its effectiveness with  
measurements from an IRB-approved user measurement study. We demonstrate the 
potential of this platform using case studies of application built atop Meddle; namely,
controlling privacy leaks, detecting ISP interference with 
Internet traffic, and blocking malware.
