\subsection*{Abstract}
Today's mobile systems are walled gardens inside gated communities:  locked-down 
operating systems running on mobile devices that communicate over opaque mobile 
networks. Researchers and mobile users have little visibility into the network 
traffic generated by their devices and have poor control over how, when, and where that traffic is sent.

This paper presents Meddle, a platform that addresses these limitations by interposing on mobile 
device traffic regardless of where and how the device connects to the Internet. Meddle leverages 
VPNs and software middleboxes to improve transparency and control 
for Internet traffic from mobile systems, while providing clear incentives, strong privacy guarantees, 
and ease of deployment to end users.  The Meddle deployment is publicly available to users and 
the source code will be released under an open source license.

We describe the design and implementation of Meddle, and evaluate it on flows generated by 
users participating in an IRB-approved study.  We show that Meddle is sufficiently efficient 
and scalable to support a large user population, and its overheads are reasonable and can be offset 
by incentives for users.  We build several concrete applications of Meddle: detecting ISP interference with Internet traffic, 
and identifying and blocking both privacy leaks and malware.
