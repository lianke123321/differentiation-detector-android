\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We described \meddle, a platform to gaining visibility and control over 
network flows from mobile devices. \meddle presents new opportunities for researchers 
to experiment with middlebox services on Internet traffic generated by mobile users, and 
provides a variety of clear incentives for users to participate in the system. We demonstrated 
the effectiveness of our approach based on controlled experiments, a small user study and 
case studies of applications built atop \meddle. Our ongoing work focuses on inviting more 
users to participate in our study (including in developing regions such as China and India), 
developing additional \meddlebox services and opening 
the platform to other researchers.
