Mobile networks are arguably the most popular, fastest growing 
systems in today's Internet ecosystem. However, these networks are 
also the least understood, largely due to locked-down
operating systems running on devices that interact over a closed and
opaque mobile network.  This severely limits users' control over how
their devices use mobile networks and restricts researchers' ability
to deploy and test new in-network functionality at scale.
%Mobile users'
%currently have very limited control over their devices and its usage
%of mobile networks which restricts researchers' ability to deploy 
%and test new in-network functionality at scale.

In this paper we present \meddle, a framework that enforces
transparency in mobile networks and enables a new point of control for
meddling with mobile traffic to improve user experience.  We argue
that \meddle, which builds upon VPNs and middleboxes, is feasible to
implement, scalable and is capable of providing sufficient incentives
for adoption by a large user base. In addition, \meddle provides a
powerful framework that enables new research directions in mobile
networks.
